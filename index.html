                <p class="bismillah">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p>

                <!-- Ayahs 1-4 -->
                <div class="ayah-block">
                    <p class="arabic-text">وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَىٰ (1) وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّىٰ (2) وَمَا خَلَقَ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَىٰ (3) إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّىٰ (4)</p>
                    <p class="english-translation">By the night as it envelops (1) And by the day as it appears (2) And by [His] creation of the male and the female (3) Indeed, your efforts are diverse (4)</p>
                    <div class="tafsir">
                        <p>This is an oath from Allah by the time in which the actions of the servants occur, based on their differing states. So He said: <strong>{By the night as it envelops}</strong> [meaning: it covers] the creation with its darkness, so everyone settles in their dwelling and home, and the servants rest from their toil and hardship. <strong>{And by the day as it appears}</strong> to the creation, so they are illuminated by its light and disperse for their livelihoods and interests. <strong>{And by [His] creation of the male and the female}</strong> If the word "ma" (what/His) is a relative pronoun, then it is an oath by His noble Self, described as being the Creator of the male and female. If it is a gerund, then it is an oath by His very act of creating the male and female, and the perfection of His wisdom in doing so, for He created from every species of animal that He wishes to remain, a male and a female, so that the species may continue and not perish. And He drew each of them to the other with the chain of desire, and made each of them suitable for the other. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators.</p>
                        <p>And His statement: <strong>{Indeed, your efforts are diverse}</strong> This is the subject of the oath. Meaning: indeed, your efforts, O accountable ones, are widely divergent. This is due to the variation in the actions themselves, their quantity, the energy put into them, and according to the intended goal of those actions. Is it the Countenance of Allah, the Most High, the Everlasting? If so, the effort remains by His permanence, and its doer benefits from it. Or is it a transient, perishing goal, so the effort is nullified by its nullification and vanishes with its vanishing? And this is the case for every deed intended for other than the Countenance of Allah, the Most High, in this description. For this reason, Allah, the Most High, distinguished between the workers and described their deeds.</p>

                        <p><strong>{As for he who gives}</strong> [meaning] what he has been commanded of financial acts of worship, such as Zakat, expiations, and various expenditures and charities, and physical acts of worship, such as Salah, fasting, and their like, and those that combine both, such as Hajj and Umrah, and their like. <strong>{and has Taqwa (fears Allah)}</strong> concerning what He has forbidden, of prohibitions and sins of all kinds.</p>
                        <p><strong>{And believes in the best [reward]}</strong> meaning: he believes in "La ilaha illallah" (There is no god worthy of worship except Allah) and all that it implies of religious beliefs, and what results from it of reward in the Hereafter.</p>
                        <p><strong>{We will ease him toward ease}</strong> meaning: We will make his affair easy for him, and make every good deed easy for him to perform, and make leaving every evil deed easy for him, because he came with the means of facilitation, so Allah facilitated it for him.</p>

                    <p class="arabic-text">وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَاسْتَغْنَىٰ (8) وَكَذَّبَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ (9) فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَىٰ (10) وَمَا يُغْنِي عَنْهُ مَالُهُ إِذَا تَرَدَّىٰ (11)</p>

                    <div class="tafsir">
                         <p><strong>{But as for he who is stingy}</strong> with what he has been commanded, so he abandons obligatory and recommended spending, and his soul does not permit him to expend what Allah has obliged upon him. <strong>{and considers himself self-sufficient}</strong> from Allah, so he abandons servitude to Him, and does not see himself in dire need of his Lord, who has no salvation, no success, and no felicity for him except by Him being his beloved and his object of worship, whom he intends and turns to. <strong>{And denies the best [reward]}</strong> meaning: what Allah has obliged the servants to believe in from sound creeds. <strong>{We will ease him toward hardship}</strong> meaning: for the state of hardship and the blameworthy characteristics, such that he is made ready for evil wherever he may be, and the paths of sin are made easy for him. We ask Allah for well-being.</p>
                         <p><strong>{And his wealth will not avail him}</strong> the wealth that made him transgress and caused him to be stingy <strong>{when he plummets}</strong> and dies, for nothing accompanies him except his righteous deeds. As for his wealth from which he did not give what was obligatory, it will be a source of calamity for him, as he did not send forth anything from it for his Hereafter.</p>

                    <p class="arabic-text">إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا لَلْهُدَىٰ (12) وَإِنَّ لَنَا لَلْآخِرَةَ وَالْأُولَىٰ (13) فَأَنذَرْتُكُمْ نَارًا تَلَظَّىٰ (14) لَا يَصْلَاهَا إِلَّا الْأَشْقَى (15) الَّذِي كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ (16)</p>

                    <div class="tafsir">
                        <p><strong>{Indeed, upon Us is guidance}</strong> meaning: the straight path of guidance leads to Allah and brings one close to His pleasure. As for misguidance, its paths are blocked from reaching Allah; they only lead their follower to severe punishment.</p>
                        <p><strong>{And indeed, to Us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life]}</strong> They are Our dominion and at Our disposal; there is no one who shares with Us in them. So let those who desire seek from Us and let their hope be cut off from the creation. <strong>{So I have warned you of a Fire that blazes}</strong> meaning, it is kindled and aflame. <strong>{None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched, Who denied}</strong> the truth <strong>{and turned away}</strong> from the command.</p>

                <!-- Ayahs 17-21 -->
                <div class="ayah-block">
                    <p class="arabic-text">وَسَيُجَنَّبُهَا الْأَتْقَى (17) الَّذِي يُؤْتِي مَالَهُ يَتَزَكَّىٰ (18) وَمَا لِأَحَدٍ عِندَهُ مِن نِّعْمَةٍ تُجْزَىٰ (19) إِلَّا ابْتِغَاءَ وَجْهِ رَبِّهِ الْأَعْلَىٰ (20) وَلَسَوْفَ يَرْضَىٰ (21)</p>
                    <p class="english-translation">But the most righteous one will be kept away from it (17) He who gives his wealth to purify himself (18) And not having for anyone a favor to be rewarded (19) Except for seeking the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High (20) And he is going to be satisfied (21)</p>
                    <div class="tafsir">
                        <p><strong>{But the most righteous one will be kept away from it, He who gives his wealth to purify himself}</strong> meaning that his intention in spending is the purification of his own soul, and cleansing it from sins and defects, seeking the Countenance of Allah. This indicates that if the recommended spending includes abandoning an obligation, like a debt or a required expense, then it is not legislated. Rather, his giving is rejected by many of the scholars, because he does not purify himself by a recommended act that causes him to miss an obligation.</p>
                        <p><strong>{And not having for anyone a favor to be rewarded}</strong> meaning: there is no one from creation upon this righteous person who has a favor for which he is being repaid. It is only that he may still haveفضل and kindness towards people, so he becomes a pure servant of Allah, because he is a slave to His beneficence alone. As for one upon whom people have favors that he has not repaid or matched, then he must inevitably leave something for people and do for them what detracts from [the purity of his devotion].</p>
                        <p>This verse, although it applies to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him)—indeed, it was revealed concerning him, for he—may Allah be pleased with him—had no favor from anyone to be repaid, not even from the Messenger of Allah, except for the favor of the Prophet ﷺ which cannot be repaid, which is [the blessing of] the call to the religion of Islam, and the teaching of guidance and the religion of truth. For indeed, Allah and His Messenger have a favor over everyone, a favor that cannot be repaid or matched—it applies to everyone who is described by this noble quality. He has no favor from the creation upon him to be repaid, so his deeds remain purely for the Countenance of Allah, the Most High.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, He said: <strong>{Except for seeking the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High * And he is going to be satisfied}</strong> This righteous person will be satisfied with what Allah gives him of various honors and rewards. And all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.</p>
